What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	An empty metadata file is created that gives you the ability to:
	* create commits
	* track commits

	You do it so the computer knows where and what files to include.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It's different from the working directory in that it contains files meant to go in the repository.
	It's different from the repository because the files/changes aren't there *yet*.
	It lets you save your changes without adding them all at once.
	It lets you commit rational chunks.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have on commit per logical change?

	By comparing it to both the most recent commit and the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches let you experiment without concern for the state of your main project.
	I could use this to write my new tests.
