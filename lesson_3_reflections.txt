When would you want to use a reomore repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with multiple people, especially if you're not all in the same location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-todate with your remote repository?

	When you're working in a large group, you may want the time to work on a stable version, without concern for pushes from others derailing your work.
